Just FYI, I have it on very good authority that there is a strong inside candidate for this one.
Didn't they run a similar search a few years ago? Or maybe it was 18th century...
Yes, they did. I was interviewed for it at MLA - it was the only truly negative MLA interview experience I've ever had. Good luck to those applying, and hope that you fare better.
Q: If the interview requests were to go out last week, and I haven't heard anything, can I assume I've not been selected to interview?
A: Hard to say. I assume someone from the SC posted the information above about scheduling interviews. They may have asked interview candidates not to post further updates to this job wiki, which is why no other info has been posted. Or they may have had a hard time deciding on the interview list. Perhaps that poster will be kind enough to step back in at some point with another update.

Yes - I got the same information. Phone interviews will be scheduled the week of Jan 23-28. Campus interviews will be held mid-February.
People should know by next week (probably by Wednesday, 2/2) whether or not they will be invited to campus. I had my interview and I was very nervous at first.

I'm an advanced assistant professor thinking of applying. Does anyone know whether Princeton will tenure its assistant professors, or is it like Harvard and Yale, which are very, very unlikely to tenure assistant professors?
I'm not at Princeton, but from what I understand from others (at least one of whom was denied tenure at Princeton), historically tenure has been very difficult for assistants to achieve there (so, yes, closer to how Harvard and Yale have been traditionally).
Don't take this as settled fact, but I've most recently heard (from an assistant professor at Princeton) that the current tenure rate is about 1/3.
For what it's worth, this vacancy was created when an associate professor who had risen through the ranks at Princeton (i.e., who had started as an assistant professor and had earned tenure) left to go elsewhere.",http://www.higheredjobs.com/faculty/details.cfm?JobCode=175460177,Early Modern,315

I am just curious if anyone else found the deadline for this job to be early. Is this a sign that there is an inside job candidate?
It is a bit early, but this dept. is also running a search for an Americanist VAP with the same deadline, so I'm not sure it means ""inside candidate"" . . . maybe it's just how they roll there . . .?
I truly hope the early deadlines do not mean that this department is planning to get a ""jump"" on other schools and make job offers before the MLA convention. Aside from the fact that this will create the potential for some very unpleasant business, I believe that early hiring is contrary to policies established by the MLA
Not to worry. If I remember the job posting correctly, they are planning on interviewing at the MLA this year.
Does anyone know if this job search is still on? It has been quite a while since the deadline, and I would think that if they wanted to interview at MLA there would have been some word from the committee by now.
I wouldn't worry. There has yet to be word from most of these jobs. From what I've seen personally this year, committees may be taking advantage of the later MLA meeting date to take more time considering applications.",http://www.higheredjobs.com/faculty/details.cfm?JobCode=175460943,Early Modern,315

Evergreen State College - 18th century British/Anglophone Fiction,2012,http://www.evergreen.edu/facultyhiring/jobs/britishliterature12.htm | http://chronicle.com/jobs/0000708153-01/,Unknown,Restoration/18th-Century,Wiki,"The Evergreen State College seeks applicants for a full time, regular faculty position in 18th century British/Anglophone literature with a specialization in fiction. The successful candidate must be committed to teaching literature to beginning and advanced undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary setting. The successful candidate will demonstrate both depth in the historical period and a theoretical field of specialization and enthusiasm for teaching writing and a wide range of literature written in English. Candidates must have college level teaching experience. Additionally, they must be able to speak and write effectively about their own work and that of others, and must be prepared to actively support students to develop critical thinking skills.
Evergreen organizes its curriculum through coordinated interdisciplinary studies (rather than through departments and courses). Team-taught interdisciplinary ""programs"" occupy students full time, over multiple quarters. Faculty on teaching teams enjoy a high degree of freedom to determine the subject matter, emphases, pace, classroom strategies and modes of evaluation in these programs. In some years, faculty teach students working close to their own discipline at a variety of experience levels; in other years they join faculty from diverse disciplines to develop a theme-based curriculum. In keeping with this teaching and learning model, ideal candidates for this position will demonstrate engagement with one or more disciplines outside of literature relevant to the period. For example, candidates with interests or expertise in the political philosophies of the period or contemporary conceptualizations of nature or space would be well prepared to contribute to thematic teaching teams. We encourage those who have had experience with students from underrepresented populations to apply.
In addition to teaching, faculty are expected to advise and mentor students and participate in Evergreen's system of shared governance. Through their participation in shared governance, faculty play a significant role in most aspects of how the college is run.
Minimum Qualifications: * PhD in British or Anglophone literature or related field by September 1, 2012. * Demonstrated expertise in British or Anglophone 18th century fiction. * College-level teaching experience. * Demonstrated ability to teach literature and writing at the college level. * Demonstrated potential for excellence in teaching in an interdisciplinary context.
Preferred Qualifications: * Experience working with diverse and underrepresented populations. * Experience pursuing innovative and engaging teaching strategies working with faculty from other disciplines.
This is a Regular Faculty position, eligible for continuing appointment after two, three-year renewable contracts. All application materials must be submitted by January 17, 2012 for further consideration.

Nov 10, 2013: Is there a reason that the RSS updates are not showing up on the actual page itself? I'm still about 2-3 days behind. I can see changes made on recent updates, but when I search the regular Restoration 18th C wiki, it's largely not updated to match. Glitch of some sort?
Usually, there is a bit of a lag with the RSS updates available at the top of the page (probably a slight glitch with Wikia, yes). If you use a third-party RSS reader to receive the page feed, however, there shouldn't be much of a lag. For what it's worth, the feed at the top of the page seems to be fully updated right now [11/11/13].

The main duties of the post will be to deliver tutorial teaching at undergraduate level for the College (8 hours per week in term); to deliver 16 lectures or classes per year for the Faculty’s undergraduate and Masters courses, to supervise graduate students, to engage in research and to contribute to the examining and admissions processes as necessary.

The Further Particulars did say that long-shortlisted candidates would be asked to send in writing samples by 7 December, so they've certainly made their preliminary decisions by now, but I've yet to receive their reportedly kind and balanced rejection letter.

Right now the British system is so overloaded with strong candidates that you practically have to have a book contract just to get near the long list.

NOTES AND QUERIES:
Cross-posted at Irish 2011
Are people reading ""advance[d] assistant"" as meaning someone already in a t/t job?
Yes, that would seem to be a logical reading of the ad language, esp. since the other option is ""beginning associate"" which means someone with tenure already. I'm sure many less advanced people will apply anyway though . . .
Generally, ""advanced assistant"" means someone who could come in on an accelerated tenure clock, e.g., go up in three years rather than the normal six. This means that they probably want someone with at least 3-5 articles and, ideally, a book in press (at least this has been my experience). It's UCLA, so they're going to be looking for a sure-thing future superstar.",,British: Modern/Contemp.,110

Would a recent PhD be considered for this job, considering that it's an ""endowed chair""? It says an ""advanced scholar"" but the minimum requirement is only a PhD.
Same question, but it can't hurt to apply and then you'll find out I guess.
I read this again and I think there may be an oversight, ""an advanced scholar"" would not be compatible with someone who is ABD. I don't think they'd really consider someone ABD.
This search is looking for someone in the Associate or Full rank.
Thanks so much for this info. Could you tell us how you know, and what led them to let go of the idea of looking at more junior candidates?
My source is confidential but the ad says ""advanced scholars"" and it's an endowed chair. They want a track record of scholarly accomplishment.

3/13 What I would like to know is simply this: How in the bloody hell can a department fail a search in a market like this, when they can draw from a wide, deep pool of amazing modernist scholars--many of whom remain only contingently employed? This is absolutely ridiculous. Shame on Dartmouth, seriously.
No knowledge of this specific situation, but internal department politics can cause searches to fail in any market. Making a hire in any department requires (more or less) consensus among diverse factions. Sometimes such consensus cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of the candidates. If one person could make the decision, the hiring process would be a lot easier, I'm sure, but hiring for academic positions is usually a collective endeavor, which always injects another layer of complication into the process.
I know that an offer had been made, but it was turned down. I guess that they didn't feel like moving down the list...
Fair point about the possibility of being scuppered by politics at the last stage; but the lack of willingness to return to the MLA applicant pool, and the ghostly hordes beyond? Isn't that just snobbery? Cutting one's nose of to spite &c. ? Boo, Dartmouth.
As a member of a search committee that produced a failed outcome a few years ago, I can tell you first hand that not returning to the MLA applicant pool may have nothing to do with snobbery. There are administrative forces/financial issues beyond the commitee's control that dictate the terms of the search--and these often prohibit the creation of a whole new slate of campus interviews after the first round. I am on the market this year as well and I feel your frustration at the process, but know that that failings of the system can also frustrate search committees who would love to be able to return to great candidates if their ""first"" choice (who is often picked strategically to avoid this very issue) turns down the offer.

NOTES: Website seems to imply there is a 4/3 teaching load. Anyone know if this is still accurate?
Would those who made the short-list mind sharing their area of focus? I was really surprised not to get this, but it might be that they aren't looking for an Africanist.
Has anyone else not heard either way? (12/5) ...in the same boat... my hypothesis: Saturday wasn't long enough to send out 200-400 email rejections... more to come next week. (I'm toward the end of the alphabet.) (12/5) -- OP here, got my rejection this morning. Last name near the end of the alphabet too.
No, and this was one of the first apps, I sent (12/5).
Rejection again, can anybody suggest what an ABD on F1 should do if there's no job at hand and you are scheduled to graduate next summer?!! Are there any other international students here?
I am in the same boat; I do not know what to say to you. I have lost much sleep over this issue in the last 5 months.
Do not graduate, as then you will have only 1 year to get a job.
That doesn't work out either: this is the last year of my graduate funding too, my school doesn't extend funding! Maybe I will have to go back to my country (with no instant jobs there as well !!).
I believe this market is rougher for ABD's than in years past because of the terrible market of the last several years -- there is a glut of qualified people with PhD's in hand and solid teaching/publishing records beyond the PhD who are not in TT jobs yet. ABDs are going to have a very hard time in this climate. That said, and not to seem overly optimistic, you should keep applying for anything and everything that seems remotely plausible beyond the MLA season -- jobs will keep showing up through the winter/spring (we're moving to a more year-round market I think). ABD's & recent PhD's will sometimes have better luck in the ""off-season"" market. Although nothing is guaranteed of course . . .
Last year I was second choice at a great school and I only lost to a person who graduated 8 years before me. I was of course ABD. I couldnt believe my eyes. You should ask your university to consider your position as an international student and at least give you adjunct jobs so that you do not have to immediately graduate. Also, like me, apply to all jobs. I have applied to 4/4 jobs in South Carolina as well. Check out a few composition jobs too. Once you get your first job at any place, you will I think have better chance of moving around. But as ABD there is real problem. And of course publish, publish publish. Not in silly online places but solid journals.",https://apply.icjobs.org/applicants/jsp/shared/frameset/Frameset.jsp?time=1283965326627,Anglophone/Postcolonial,194

This job does not appear on the JIL, in The Chronicle, or the university website. A mistake?
No, not a mistake: I am the poster; the Chronicle ad simply hasn't been put up yet, but it will be in the next few weeks.
A note for anyone interested, though this comment does not concern Koc in particular. Academic jobs east of the UK, even in parts of Europe, do not work the way you might expect. If you apply for this one, or others, especially in the Middle East--Lebanon and Egypt, for example--you will be interviewed by the dean, over the phone, and sent a contract in the mail. No faculty involvement, and probably no face to face at the MLA and on your first day your colleagues will be, well, very surprised to see a new office mate. If you have an office. Simply put, faculty have no rights and perks there as we do in the US and this concerns everything. Even the wrong comment on a curriculum matter might result in revocation of your work permit and an escort to the airport. Or worse treatment. If you don't believe me think about what it might mean to the university and beyond if you, say, decided to teach a feminist novel or theoretical text, or a novel with a sympathetic gay character, or a novel about an embattled minority in the country concerned (take your pick here and plug it in--Gypsies, Palestinians, Jews, Armenians, Shia in some places, Copts...). So, consider the authoritarian nature of the government concerned, and remember, you have no rights there as you do here. No AAUP standards, no due process, no academic freedom, nothing. If this works for you, and you can keep quiet and let it all go, well, these sorts of jobs are for you. If not, adjunct a little more in the US, work on that article or book, and when you get a stable job here, take a sabbatical break there, again, if you can look the other way. It took me a many years of work abroad in just this sort of job to see the light and appreciate why we have tenure and other forms of job security here in the US. There should be a special wiki site for overseas jobs so that prospective faculty can read about what they might be signing up for. And the AAUP should step up as American faculty go abroad. We need real protection from real dangers.
With all due respect, I don't think the above comment belongs here. While the poster seems genuinely frustrated with his/her past experiences abroad, this comment admittedly ""does not concern Koc in particular."" For the record, Koc is a prestigious, American-style university that--amongst other things--conducts flybacks, etc. during its hiring process.
Q: Does this university also have an American-style tenure system?
11/30 As the poster of the disputed comment let me say that I do know a bit about Koc from my own experience dealing with them and from a friend who taught there a few years ago. They are not an American style university with tenure and the usual committee processes--they work top down, and faculty simply do not have rights and the same role there as here. This is not unusual for universities outside the US and most faculty find out too late to their horror and dismay, not frustration. It is time to pay attention and shed some light on this problem as our university model is exported as cultural capital. We take our hides to the market and get a hiding.
Another--and presumably unbiased--discussion about this particular university from the Chronicle forum: http://chronicle.com/forums/index.php?topic=54077.0
QUESTION: Does anyone know the job search time frame for Turkish universities? Or has anyone heard back from Koc? It has been almost 6 weeks since the application deadline and I have not heard anything from them. Is this a normal wait period for Turkey, or have they already offered the job to someone? Any information would be highly appreciated.

NOTES AND QUERIES:
PhD at time of application or by time of appointment?
--Given the way the ad is written, it sounds like in hand PLUS a year of teaching as a PhD; and it is for assistant or associate, implying that they are looking for someone who already has his/her degree in hand. But one never knows unless they specify.
And the eternal question of just what belongs in a dossier? Experience? Thoughts?
Based on the lanugage of the ad, it seems by ""dossier"" they just mean the letters--that is what is specified. It looks like they are looking for someone more at the advanced assistant level, rather than fresh PhD or ABD, but I have no special inside information to confirm that, just a reading of the ad language, which may or may not mean much in the end. You should apply anyway, b/c you never know
I've heard that a generic ""dossier"" typically includes LORs and a diss abstract..
--Can't help asking: did those who have had writing sample requests already send well ahead of the deadline, or by Nov. 1?
-- Received request for writing sample though I submitted on the deadline (11/1).
--Received request for writing sample though submitted right before the deadline.
Anybody know when to expect MLA invitations now that conference is later?
--also for those who've gotten writing sample requests: are they considering assistant level, or just early associate?
--I received wirting sample request and applied just before deadline. I'm applying for assistant professor--have been a post-doc for two years--so apparently they are considering at assistant professor level.
Thanks for the details, and good luck!
--This appears to be a downgrade of a senior search the department ran unsuccessfully for several years. The first year applicants received a letter from the search committee chair indicating that the position had been filled, but had then fallen through, and asked if they'd like their applications kept current for the second year. During the second year, there was no communication (not that I received at least) beyond an acknowledgement of receipt of materials. The poor communication with applicants during this second cycle was enough to keep me from wasting time applying again. I hope it goes better this year. Good luck everyone!
--asked for a writing sample after the deadline, but haven't heard anything since. I'm ABD, will have Ph.D in hand in August.",,Regional,18

NOTES AND QUERIES:
Are they still doing this search now that they've lured Declan Kiberd away from UCD?
YES! This position is posted in the wake of the departure of Maud Ellmann and Luke Gibbons.
--Just curious, as I seem to be out of the gossip loop on this one, but where have Ellmann and GIbbons gone? I did hear a couple of years ago from a mutual acquaintance that Ellmann was not that happy at Notre Dame. Does anyone know who might be up for this advanced position? Interesting stuff...
A: I've heard Ellmann moved to U. of Chicago.
A: Gibbons in Maynooth
how long does process take?
Any word on who got the job?
don't believe offer has been made yet (11/2)
11/9 update: have heard they are bring in a number of candidates, with visits running until early December. Not clear when an offer might be made.
do we know who is being interviewed?
Five finalists were brought to campus recently. I have just found out from a well-placed source that none of them will be hired for this position. This search will now be continued into the spring. Very interesting.
Heard that too. They are probably looking for another 'star' name. It seems to be their way.
has the search continued?

NOTES AND QUERIES:
Has anyone heard anything about interviews or the DVD teaching demo request (that was mentioned in the original job posting)? I'm wondering if Framingham is on a different timetable and not planning to interview at MLA...
I've heard nothing, but I'm thinking that this job is probably a victim of budget cuts.
I was asked for the DVD demo around mid-December and submitted it before Xmas. They viewed those, I think, instead of MLA interviews. Haven't heard anything in the interim, though.
Thanks for posting that. Even though they didn't ask me for a DVD, it's encouraging to know that the search wasn't cancelled. Good luck!

Harvard University (2013?),2012,,Unknown,Early American,Wiki,"This may not be the place for a rumored position, but I heard that Harvard English conducted at least five phone interviews last November to replace an outgoing assistant-level early Americanist. I heard this directly from a Harvard English fac member, albeit not one involved in the search. It's not surprising to hear that the search was not publicly advertised. (I suppose they just picked their likely candidates instead.) This does seem to happen a lot with searches for tenured positions at prestigious universities, but doing this at the assistant level seems very unusual. Can anyone confirm this?
I can confirm that an early Americanist at the assistant level left mid-year for another position. I hadn't heard that they did phone interviews, however.

It means send whatever might suggest effective teaching and research: teaching philosophy and scores, abstract, etc.

Perhaps they're letting Rose Nyland conduct the search and she's exasperated by all the applications?
Now, now, you know Dorothy will keep them all in line. Except that sassy Sophia.
Friend of a friend says that Blanche Devereaux will soon be contacting the short list with a materials request for headshots.
You all sound so sweet and funny. I wish we could all grab a cheesecake at the MLA.
Cheesecake? But we have to provide headshots per Blanche! I need to look my slim best. heh heh ;) Seriously, we do seem to be a friendly bunch. Usually, everyone is giving everyone else the side-eye. It's nice we're not made crazy by the search ... yet
The economy is so bad. I think it is senseless to be catty. Of course, we are all motivated by self-interest....but, because the process seems to be such a crapshoot, I am inclined to just be happy for people and hope that some day I am lucky enough to get a decent job doing what I love to do. Don't get me wrong; I can have my hissy Sofia moments. Tee hee.
If I wanted to be snarky, I'd have moved over to history a long time ago. Honestly, if you didn't think of Rose, Blanche, Dorothy, and Sophia while writing the job letter for St. Olaf, I pity you.....cause I watched the season 4 DVD (the best season, in my opinion) while writing mine. Nothing but the best of luck to all of you, and I really mean that. No reason for competition on an anonymous wiki! Cheesecake to all.

Thank you for being a friend! heh By the way, any word on this one? At all? Anything? Class? Class?
Nothing at all, but still hopeful! (12/18) (x2)
I remained hopeful after NOT getting one of the 12/21 rejection emails, but the hope has now died: I checked the status of my electronic application and it so sweetly states ""No longer being considered."" Guess my rejection email is on the way (or lost in interwebs).

The on-line ap for this position is out of control. There are at least 5 places to attach ""other"" documents (unspecified), and the ap isn't considered complete until all of the attachments are filled. Ridiculous.
Also worth noting that this school has no tenure system
Very problematic rejection letter.....""does not have minimum educational requirements"" but I have a PhD and publications in exactly the field advertised! Remarkably offensive.
I think you might have checked the wrong box for one of the questions, which was like: ""Have you spent x hours teaching..."" - sorry, but I forget the exact wording. I think if you checked no, that might have called for such an outrageous response. A: I wouldn't put it past me that I messed up! Thanks. Actually, it was an HR mistake, and they apologized so it is all good.

The email was kindly written and reflects well on the department. (x3)
Has anyone heard anything about MLA interviews? (12/20): From the search committee chair to any candidates reading this wiki (and yes, search committee chairs sometimes look here!): we're late contacting people about interviews due to some shifting travel plans--until that was settled we couldn't actually schedule interview times. But we'll be contacting 12 people for MLA interviews over the next couple of days. <-- Thank you for posting! (x2)
Hi, someone added ""MLA Interviews Scheduled"" in the title, but that section of the wiki is still blank.... Did someone actually get a call or are you just responding to the Chair's comment above? Answer: maybe this is a violation of protocol on the wiki, but I'm the SCC, and I added it myself once I was done scheduling all the interviews. I was on the market in the dark ages before wikis, but I would have wanted to know. <--Thanks for the info, SCC! > Warm congrats to those who got the interviews and thanks to SCC for being exceptionally considerate.

""tenure-line assistant professor who specializes in American, Chicano/a, and southwestern literary and cultural studies from the Progressive Era (1910s) to the present. Desirable secondary qualifications include expertise in interdisciplinary methodologies and critical regionalisms, though we prefer projects that are decidedly literary.

Deadline: The search committee will begin to review applications on December 7, 2010 and continue the screening process until the position is filled. Preliminary interviews will take place by telephone.
FYI: This will likely be an inside hire. Q: How do you know?
I'm not the original poster, but a colleague went to grad school at UNM and still keeps in touch with some of the people there and said the same thing. Check out the VAP--there's definitely merit to the inside hire. A: Thanks for the info.
Q. Thanks for the info, but what does VAP mean? VAP= visiting assistant professor.
Q. Any new news on this search? A: Second-hand info from a source close to the search committee chair says that the inside hire rumor, while certainly not without merit, is also in no way definite. The VAP is a smart and well-connected individual but also may face serious competition from better-qualified or more well-suited candidates. This source also claims that a first round of rejections were sent out in December.

Also posted at Comparative 2011 & Anglophone 2011
Note from the Anglophone page: ""A note for anyone interested, though this comment does not concern Koc in particular. Academic jobs east of the UK, even in parts of Europe, do not work the way you might expect. If you apply for this one, or others, especially in the Middle East--Lebanon and Egypt, for example--you will be interviewed by the dean, over the phone, and sent a contract in the mail. No faculty involvement, and probably no face to face at the MLA and on your first day your colleagues will be, well, very surprised to see a new office mate. If you have an office. Simply put, faculty have no rights and perks there as we do in the US and this concerns everything. Even the wrong comment on a curriculum matter might result in revocation of your work permit and an escort to the airport. Or worse treatment. If you don't believe me think about what it might mean to the university and beyond if you, say, decided to teach a feminist novel or theoretical text, or a novel with a sympathetic gay character, or a novel about an embattled minority in the country concerned (take your pick here and plug it in--Gypsies, Palestinians, Jews, Armenians, Shia in some places, Copts...). So, consider the authoritarian nature of the government concerned, and remember, you have no rights there as you do here. No AAUP standards, no due process, no academic freedom, nothing. If this works for you, and you can keep quiet and let it all go, well, these sorts of jobs are for you. If not, adjunct a little more in the US, work on that article or book, and when you get a stable job here, take a sabbatical break there, again, if you can look the other way. It took me a many years of work abroad in just this sort of job to see the light and appreciate why we have tenure and other forms of job security here in the US. There should be a special wiki site for overseas jobs so that prospective faculty can read about what they might be signing up for. And the AAUP should step up as American faculty go abroad. We need real protection from real dangers.""
QUESTION: Does anyone know the job search time frame for Turkish universities? Or has anyone heard back from Koc? It has been almost 6 weeks since the application deadline and I have not heard anything from them. Is this a normal wait period for Turkey, or have they already offered the job to someone? Any information would be highly appreciated. Thanks!",http://chronicle.com/jobs/0000660023-01 | http://www.ku.edu.tr/ku/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4571&Itemid=3726,Generalist,597

I was warned *very* strongly by a former visiting faculty member against taking a position here, FYI. 1/11.
What reasons were given? 
They weren't able to get into specifics at the time, but described the institution as impossible to teach for.
Anyone hear back at all? (3/16)

If the listing says review of materials will begin November 15, why is the committee already requesting additional materials? Is it common practice for schools to start the review process early?
- Sorry, that was a mistake on my part: I meant to fill in acknowledgment received and went down one line too far. I've deleted that entry and added a tally in the acknowledgment received column.
A new low - rejected for this position, and I didn't even apply for it???
Top candidates were supposed to be notified in early January. Any word?
RE: early January notification: I asked the department chair about this a couple of weeks ago. He said there was an incorrect e-mail sent out suggesting an early January notification, and that they weren't planning on making a decision until after MLA. I assume if they have made a decision by this point, it's being vetted by the administation--that's just how they roll.
I just got a rejection email today (1/27) addressed to someone who is not me. Don't know what to make of that.
I also got a rejection addressed to someone else. I followed up, they apologized, but said I was indeed out of the running.",https://apply.interfolio.com/26799,Generalist,597

Q. Anyone have a precise definition of ""nationally recognized press""?
A. It means that if you publish with a small press, then the press must have a solid national reputation. No vanity presses. No small presses that only publish ten books a year. The press has to have some kind of reputation to back it up and positive name recognition within the poetry community.
A. To follow up on that previous answer, 10 books a year is actually quite an awesome publication schedule for many nationally-recognized small presses. You should go by the reputation of the press, not number of books they publish per year.",http://www.insidehighered.com/career/seekers/posts/view/150240,Creative Writing,1039

NOTES: Person 1: Did anyone on this Wiki even apply for this job?
Person 2: No. Question though: so I'm hearing that, on average, 300 ppl apply for some of these jobs. How many of those 300 have a book and a PhD? In other words, of those 300 how many are actually in the running? Seems hard to believe that there's really 300 ppl with books and PhDs all applying for these jobs...but then again, perhaps I'm ignorant. R/Q: Did this job ask for a PhD?
R: Fewer people here will have applied for this, Brown, &...which am I forgetting...b/c they're Associate, which presumes a higher level of experience, often several books, etc. I didn't apply b/c w/ an MFA & one book, I'm not qualified. The people who turned it down last year had several books and national reputations.
Person 3: Looks like one person on this Wiki applied for this job and one person got asked for a ton of dossier materials? Why wouldn't you think anyone on this Wiki would apply for this job? As to the above: I think your numbers are a little high. I've been on two different creative writing search committees (one in each genre) and you get around 175 apps. 25 don't even have the right degree and shouldn't have applied in the first place; 25 more don't meet the minimum requirements of the ad and shouldn't have applied in the first place, or they're trying to pass themselves off as fiction writers when they're poets or something like that; 50 don't have books or the books sound like they were self-published (whether or not the ad calls for a book); and another 25 don't have nearly enough teaching experience. That leaves 50 people in the running, and it's pretty easy to get that down to 10 or 12 because those 10 or 12 are so much better than the others. It seems to me that if you make it to the phone interview/MLA interview stage, you have a really good shot because half those people reveal that no one could possibly work with them. And you have the literature faculty to contend with on some committees. They have bizarre and unkown agendas. It makes it harder and harder to end up with the person you really want. I would imagine that most times the person who gets the job was ranked very low in the top ten before the interviewing starts. But my experience is very limited. Just don't underestimate how many people apply for jobs without a chance in the world of getting the position (unless someone on the committee wildly misreads the CV: and this happens).
Person 2: Thanks for the breakdown, #3. That makes me feel a *little* better. Those are still slim odds, though I'd like to think I'm in that top 50 for a good deal of these jobs. Thank you, again.
Person 3: I'm sure you're high in that top fifty, so I wish you the best of luck.
Person 4: Looks like they're starting this search over again. Offers made last year to Kevin Young (stayed at Emory) and Kevin Prufer (chose U of Houston instead).
Person 5: I have PhD and books, applied and didn't get any word at all.
Person 3: What happened with the one person who got phone interviewed?
Person 3 again: Does anyone know what happened with this job?",http://chronicle.com/jobs/0000646774-01,Creative Writing,1039

A (I just happened to see these Qs--no idea when they were posted, sorry!): I know. I got the January email too. It was very confusing. My take on it is that this chair was a little too ""kind"" for his--or, anyway, our--own good. It was confusing and tended to get my hopes up too high.

A: The fiction campus visit were supposed to precede the nonfiction, which will come at the end of the month.

Q: I didn't know they had already done campus interviews, only phone interviews. Am I wrong?
A: The rejection came after a phone interview. It may have come earlier than others; I asked for that courtesy, in order to respond to other concluding searches.
Q: Thanks for clarifying. I had a phone interview and received a rejection today, but it was awkwardly worded and not personalized (which is okay). Almost seemed like a form rejection--which is fine--but it was unclear since it stated that I wouldn't be ""interviewed for the position"" but I just had a phone interview. Would have helped if it said ""campus interview."" I'm scratching my noggin over that one.
A: I have no idea how you're supposed to handle a phone interview. I've had great success with in-person interviews, but phone interviews . . . none. What can you possibly say? Especially in a mere 15 minutes?
-- I've had the same experience. Phone interviews are much harder than in-person chats with the committee, precisely because you can't have a chat. My mistake was trying to have a conversation with the committee -- over the phone. It didn't work. I switched to lecture mode and got better results. I answered each question with a 5-minute mini-lecture, and curiously, interviews began to feel a lot smoother. I'm sure there are other approaches, probably better ones, and I'd love to hear from other people.
--I think it's a fine line between advertising yourself with that lecture mood and also trying to have a conversation. Keep in mind, these people will be your colleagues and vice versa--they want someone who fits into the department. And sometimes that means you won't fit, which is hard not to take personally. But a lot of factors go into that decision. And, just to clarify, I wasn't upset that I wasn't invited for a campus interview. I was just confused about the wording the email--I wasn't ""selected for an interview,"" but I would consider a phone interview just that! It was very confusing, especially since I thought the phone interview went swimmingly. But hey, who knows? It's all a crapshoot.

QUESTION for New Hires: What salary are you being given? What were you originally offered?
A: If you are interested in salary information, there is a separate page for that: English Lit Salaries 2011-2012.
I appreciate this link, but since nothing on English Lit Salaries is specific to Creative Writers or Poets, and since the job markets can be slightly different, I think it would still be useful to discuss creative writing salaries, whether here or elsewhere.
A: Okay, I think Q&A section below would be the best place for that inquiry. Section on Creative Writing Salaries added.
Note to ""why be shy"" poster: One reason to be shy is because some job candidates already teach elsewhere, but haven't gotten tenure yet, and don't want to alienate their current department, in case the newer position doesn't pan out & they have to stay (which happens for many reasons: salary, spousal hire, courseload, tenure clock, etc.) This really does seem obvious (even to me, though I'm jobless), so my question is: why be a pest? Who appointed you town nag? The information that's here—job postings, rundowns of the avg. qualifications to get a job, info about cover letter length etc.—is pretty helpful. So if you can't avoid clogging up the page with your frustrations, consider moving your clogs to the Q &A section...then try inserting a handy sideways box....
OP: Easy there tiger... no one's meaning to offend anyone! Your point about not wanting to alienate other co-workers is well-taken. The world is just curious to know which lucky, talented people rise to the top for good jobs. Please take your frustrations out on some other horse.
NP: Yes but (in response to the above) isn't this Wiki intended to help rather than harm candidates, potential candidates, students, colleagues, and the like? If someone isn't ready or willing for her name to be publicized for all the aforementioned obvious reasons (and others not yet mentioned), I think it's fair to respect that. Word gets out eventually, for those curious/interested, but information sensitivity is probably most important for those directly affected.",http://submitit.blogspot.com/2011/04/missions-accomplished.html,Creative Writing,1039

Q: I know this was discussed a bit last year, but how do chapbooks fit in here?
A: If they say they want a book, chapbook won't cut it. If needing a book isn't specified, though, having a chapbook can be a plus and show promise. Keep in mind that requirements are minimums, and that places requiring one book will get applications from those with 2 and 3 and more. (This seems more the case for poets).

Question About Having Two MFAs:,2011,,Unknown,CreativeWriting,Wiki,"I got an MFA from Iowa and then I went and got another MFA from a less wellknown program (and I got poor grades at the latter); do I have to put both on my CV while applying for jobs? Is there any way for the committee to do some kind of search and find out that I attended both and demand two transcripts? Or is it fully up to me what I disclose? If I DO have to show both transcripts, does anyone think getting C/C+ grades in the second program might at all mar my unblemished transcript from Iowa? A: Yes.
A: Absolutely. It would surely make me wonder (1) why you decided to follow your Iowa degree with one from a lesser known school and (2) why you decided to do this and not care at all about your work (which is the implication when a grad student gets ""C/C+""). It looks very unprofessional. I might also wonder (3) how you graduated with those grades, as most schools don't allow a ""C"" for a grad student (akin to an ""F"" for an undergrad). If you don't disclose the latter MFA, however, be prepared to field questions about what you were doing for those three or so years.
Follow-up: Fair enough. I thought so. So the second degree is best left unmentioned. But the real question is, is there any way job search committees could find out about the second MFA even if I didn't tell them? I ask not because I want to mislead people or cheat, but because my grades at the second MFA are sincerely misleading (it was not that I didn't care about my work, but that I cared too much; I was busy finishing a book and didn't do a lot of the busywork assigned by the second MFA.).
A. Another new responder here. I agree with responder #2. Honesty is always the best policy. I know of a TT Prof. who omitted a past gig (a low res thing) on his resume because he'd been asked to leave. Needless to say, once the institution where he was found out (and he was outted by others) he was not granted tenure. They considered the omission dishonest. Also, many places will not ask for your transcripts. So having two MFAs may be more the issue than the grades.
A. New responder here. No...I don't think they could find out about the second MFA unless you raise a red flag on your CV by mentioning a fellowship or teaching experience as a graduate instructor at the other school. It should be noted that if you don't have a book published plus teaching experience, you don't have much of a shot in this market. Only three or four people got jobs without books last year, and they all had PhDs. Highlight your publications and teaching experience on your cover letter and CV, and hide the other MFA. Also, get some really good recommendation letters from your Iowa professors or colleagues who can vouch for you as a strong writer, capable teacher, and all around good guy or gal.
A. New responder #2 -- a different approach: the worst thing you could do is lie about your academic past. Your signature is going to be on a document that says ""I hereby confirm that all the above information is true and COMPLETE."" 20 years from now, when you're poet laureate, someone will dig up your hidden transcript -- your presence at the second MFA is well documented, all the files exist somewhere -- and you will be disgraced and defrocked. See the case of Quincy Troupe, for example. Why don't you tell them the truth? Be honest -- tell them exactly what you told us. Chances are they'll appreciate your sincerity. It's better to admit to mistakes than to try and conceal them -- or pretend they never happened.
A: Responder #3--Ditto what #2 said. The CW world is very small, and I'd bet anything it wouldn't take them 20 years to find out.
You'll have to explain those 2 years on your Vita, for one thing.
A: Agree with #2 and #3. You can always remember the truth, but you'll inevitably stumble on the lie. Plus, why not confront the life experience of it instead of shamefully pretending two years of your life didn't happen? Just tell them, ""it was a disappointing academic experience and I hope to use that to help inform my future teaching."" I think an interviewing committee would be interested to hear someone confront a 'failure.' I mean, yeah, it's not going to make you a favorite for a position, but if you're first act as a new employee is a cover-up and lies, well...good luck with that!
Seriously, though, the elements that made this a negative experieice would be valuable to remember in an academic setting. Your own students will no doubt behave the exact same way that you did.
A. I'm all for truth and honesty, but this isn't a job market where a person can have a mere MFA and no book and get a TT job. And an MFA, plus a book, plus a negative MFA experience will raise so many red flags that most search committees will pass on such a candidate in favor of the twenty or thirty MFAs and PhDs who have books, teaching experience, and no red flags. My advice: Don't waste your money or time on the pie in the sky jobs. If you don't have a book and want to be honest on your applications, then apply to adjunt jobs, instructorships, or one-year visiting positions that will help you build a good reputation. In the mean time, write and publish a damn good book.
A: in response to comment above: sort of. Several people who were pre-book did get jobs last year, and have jobs elsewhere (though many of these--and all of the ones last year--were PhDs). I only add this because I think pre-book people should still appy to places where they think they might be a good fit. No use applying Oregon or Virginia, of course, but some of these places have very specific needs.
A: A different viewpoint: Most search committees do not ask for transcripts up front, only letters of recommendation. So, putting both MFAs on your vita does not immediately conjur the lugubrious C+ (though committees will wonder why you attended another MFA program after earning one from the reputed #1 Iowa; if anything, that is something you will have to explain up front). If you advance though the stages of candidacy to an offer, the Dean's office will ask for originals of all your materials, including transcripts. Only at that point will they see your grades, and it may just be the Dean, not the search committee, and the Dean may or may not really care what grades you made considering her university has spent so much money to decide to offer you a job. In any event, the grades seem less of an issue than the fact that you have two MFA degrees, both of which should be acknowledged in your vita. If you address that seeming redundancy in your job letter, you will be answering a committee's burning question, though you are not obligated to.",,Creative Writing,1039
Who Would Win????,2011,http://www.helonhabila.com/About.html,Unknown,CreativeWriting,Wiki,"Hands Across the Water I: MFAs / MAs / PhDs in the USA and the UK
There has been discussion about creative programs in the USA and how they all stack up. How are programs in the UK viewed in the USA?
Who would win:
Creative PhD Utah vs Creative PhD UEA
A: Has anybody with a creative PhD from England gotten a job in the States?
A: Helon Habila is completing/completed(?) link a PhD from UEA and is teaching at George Mason University.
C: Just as in the States, there are only a few Creative PhD programs in the UK. As such, there are only a handful of UK Creative PhDs out there. And, of those few who hold a Creative PhD, those who do get jobs most often stay in the UK (just as is the case with Creative PhDs in the States staying in the States). That said, it is a good question: does anyone on this list have a Creative PhD from the UK? How is/was the job hunt? And, for people who have been on the administration side of the table, how does a Creative PhD from the UK factor in?
C: The only thing I'd add to the above is that there are actually about a few dozen creative PhDs in the States, which is more than ""only a few"" so that throws things out of whack a bit. They range from California, Utah, Louisiana, Milwaukee, Chicago, Denver, South Dakota, Mississippi, Georgia, NY, Kentucky, Missouri, Houston, Nebraska, Florida, Ohio, and still others, I'm sure. I lost track years ago.
C: Fair enough. Few is vague. Abramson's blog lists 35 in the USA, 36 in England, 5 in Wales, 3 in Scotland, and 2 in Ireland.

A: Not sure about specifying ""Recent Activity"" in that way, but if you create an ID/log-in for the site, you can choose (under 'Preferences"") to be notified by email whenever a specific page is edited. Una74 19:23, October 31, 2010 (UTC)
Q: Last year's wiki had a very helpful section where users self-identified:
http://academicjobs.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Writing_Jobs_2009-10#Who_is_using_this_Wiki:
Any chance we could have something similar here?
A. Just added it. See below. (11/28--moved to top of Q&A, per request).
Q: Would it be possible to put the ""interview"" list in its own section so it's easy to check at a glance without rifling through the Q & A?
Thanks for moving the interviews to the top--and btw--I've been on the market many years and this wiki board is the most well organized I've seen--thanks putting so much work into it--a real community service.
Q: What happened to the recent activity tab at the top of the page? I loved the recent activity tab...
A: Seems to be dependent on the browser. I can see still see ""recent activity"" with Safari browser, but not with Firefox. Wikia is still adjusting this newer interface, and sometimes things come and go somewhat mysteriously. ""Recent activity"" may yet reappear, I would be a bit patient (you can always find the full history of the page by going to ""see all activity"" in the activity feed).
Q: Is it time to post an ""interview questions"" segment on this page yet?
Q: Shouldn;t the new ""interviews"" section that popped up 1/11 be ""campus visits"" instead? We can get the AWp and MLA interview info from the lesting s themselves and the list of people scheduling first interviews already.
Q: Since offers have started, can we start a Who Got What section, and put it up top (so people will see it?)
Q: Why isn't the Belmont University Comp/CW job listed on this Wiki?!? I don't know how to add jobs to the Wiki, or I'd do it... (http://academicjobs.wikia.com/wiki/Rhetoric/Composition_2011#Belmont_University)
A: It seems like it's really more of a Rhet-Comp job, but I went ahead and cross-posted it above (under ""Open"") anyway, per request.
-- I can't argue with that. It appears to be more Rhet-Comp, but the person who told me they were interviewing for the job said the course load would be 50/50 comp/CW...anyway, thanks!

Evergreen College (WA) - Fiction,2012,http://fir.evergreen.edu/facultyemployment/facultyhiring/appform.php?position=Creative%20Writing2012,Unknown,CreativeWriting,Wiki,"The Evergreen State College seeks a full-time faculty colleague to teach creative writing in a wide range of interdisciplinary programs at the undergraduate level. The successful candidate must be professionally trained and published in fiction and at least one of the following genres: screenwriting, creative nonfiction, or graphic novel. Candidates must have experience teaching fiction and an additional writing genre at the college level, must have publications in fiction and in one other genre (in the case of screenwriting, at least one produced script).
Evergreen organizes its curriculum through coordinated interdisciplinary studies (rather than through departments and courses). Students enroll in team-taught interdisciplinary “programs” full time, often for multiple quarters. Faculty on teaching teams enjoy a high degree of freedom to determine the subject matter, emphases, pace, classroom strategies and modes of evaluation in these programs. In some years, faculty teach students working close to their own discipline at a variety of experience levels; in other years they join faculty from diverse disciplines to develop a theme-based curriculum, sometimes for first-year students, or for advanced students, or for all levels. In keeping with this teaching and learning model, ideal candidates for this position will demonstrate engagement with one or more disciplines outside of creative writing and in different social, cultural, or environmental arenas, through creative work, teaching, or research. We’re searching for a faculty member who enjoys working with other faculty to model for students and with students the collaborative strategies that multiple disciplines deploy to succeed in the scholarly and professional worlds. We also encourage applicants who have had experience teaching and/or working with students from underrepresented populations.
In addition to teaching, faculty are expected to advise and mentor students and participate in Evergreen’s system of shared governance. Through their participation in shared governance, faculty play a significant role in most aspects of how the college is run.
Apply: http://fir.evergreen.edu/facultyemployment/facultyhiring/appform.php?position=Creative%20Writing2012
Minimum Qualifications: M.F.A. or equivalent terminal degree; College level teaching experience; Publications in fiction and one other genre (screenwriting, creative nonfiction or graphic novel); and Experience integrating the teaching of creative writing with other disciplinary fields. Preferred Qualifications: Experience teaching with faculty from a variety of disciplines; and Experience teaching and/or working with students from underrepresented populations.
This is a Regular Faculty position, eligible for continuing appointment after two, three-year renewable contracts. Review of complete applications begins March 9, 2012. We will continue to accept applications until finalists are selected.
To apply, please submit the following information on our online application, link is above: Contact Information, Work Experience, Affirmative Action. Submit the following items as an attachment(s) with an email: Curriculum vitae. Letter of application. 1-2 page statement of your teaching philosophy and practice.

Examples of scholarly or artistic work. (Research papers or reviews). Evaluations by students (if available) Three current letters of reference from professional colleagues that speak to your teaching experience; in addition, letters from students are often useful.

About Evergreen: Evergreen is a public liberal arts college emphasizing integrated interdisciplinary study and team-teaching throughout the undergraduate curriculum and in three graduate programs. Teaching at Evergreen allows faculty members to exercise broad-ranging intellectual curiosity and to work collaboratively with faculty colleagues and students formulating interdisciplinary questions and inquiry.
Faculty members team-teach in full-time interdisciplinary programs. With their teaching colleagues they collaboratively design thematically-centered programs that bring together multiple disciplines. Faculty teams also strive to address core academic experiences we believe should be included in all programs: teaching writing and quantitative reasoning; deepening students’ academic, artistic and interpretative abilities and skills; promoting culturally diverse traditions of knowledge; and creating inclusive learning environments for students and faculty members.
Recognizing diversity as a defining characteristic of the 21st century, the college has intensified its efforts to become a multicultural and diverse institution. Substantive experience working across cultural differences is therefore highly desirable for all positions. Committed to equal opportunity and affirmative action, TESC is working to build a diverse, broadly trained faculty. We particularly encourage applications from candidates whose race, national origin, sex, age, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, veteran status or physical disability will contribute to our diversity.
Faculty membership is unranked with salary determined on an open scale based on earned degrees and years of relevant experience.
Evergreen's fundamental academic commitments are summarized in our Five Foci: Interdisciplinary study, Personal engagement in learning, Linking theoretical perspectives with practice, Collaborative/cooperative work, Teaching across significant differences

Warren Wilson College (NC) - CAMPUS INTERVIEW SCHEDULED,2012,http://chronicle.com/jobs/0000693960-01/,Unknown,CreativeWriting,Wiki,"The Undergraduate Writing Program of Warren Wilson College seeks a fiction writer to join our faculty and assist us in shaping our growing program. The Writing Program, which exists alongside and shares faculty and courses with the English Department, offers a creative writing major and minor with tracks in poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction. In addition, the Writing Program houses first-year writing and a Writing Center, supports a literary journal, and hosts a reading series and twice-a-year Writer-in-Residence.
This is a full-time, entry-level position in an extended contract system with a 3-3 load. All regular writing faculty teach broadly, with courses that include introductory and advanced multi-genre classes, tiered single-genre workshops, first-year composition, and occasional first-year seminars. Faculty in this position will also develop readings courses in their expertise that contribute to a category of genre-study through immersion in contemporary literatures.
We seek candidates with an M.F.A. and/or Ph.D. in Creative Writing and Literature (in hand by August 2012). The successful candidate will have significant and relevant publications, evidence of excellence in and commitment to teaching undergraduates at a residential college, and the expectation of continued creative and/or scholarly work. Warren Wilson College, known for its low-residency MFA, is a tier-one nationally ranked, independent liberal arts college organized around a unique Triad education of academics, work, and service; current campus-wide initiatives emphasize sustainability thinking and interdisciplinary teaching. (Learn more at our website: http://www.warren-wilson.edu .)
Interested candidates should submit (electronically) a cover letter, c.v., and statement of teaching philosophy to Academic Affairs (Warren Wilson College, PO Box 9000, Asheville, NC 28815-9000). Review of applications will begin November 1, 2011 and continue until the position is filled.

Deadline: review begins Nov. 1
Acknowledgment received: October 31 +1, Nov.1
Request for Additional Materials: 12/1 email. Three questions requiring narrative responses about the candidate's fit with WWC and In addition to answering these questions, the search committee requests that you forward the following: three current letters of recommendation, evidence of teaching excellence, and graduate transcripts (Also added that starting income is 45,000) (+4)
$45,000 is on the very low end of what a full-time asst. prof should make anywhere in the US. I wonder why they include that at this stage in the process: as a warning? As an opening gambit? I'm not applying for this job, but let me just say that no matter *what* they say, and no matter what your situation is, salary is something you negotiate, not something the institution gets to decide up front. If you're offered this job, tell them to take that lowball offer and shove it. Working for a progressive college (or any college) doesn't mean that you take a vow of poverty.
Random Respondent to Above: $45,000 is not that shocking. Last year 2 of my campus interviews stated the salary would be $45,000. Warren Wilson's disclosure at this early stage shows integrity and should not be considered a ""warning"" or ""opening gambit."" Look around. How many of these ads or the acknowledgments you've been receiving include the salary? Not many. You won't know the salary until you're sitting before the Chair or Dean during your campus visit and sometimes you still won't know the salary. It will come with the offer. Do I work for Warren Wilson? I wish! The place is in the mountains near Asheville. But definitely negotiate. The poster is right-on about that. Your entire salary range for the rest of your career depends on it.
Random Respondent to Above: Anyway you look at it, $45,000 is low. Anyway you look at it, asking applicants to write three small composition papers about how wonderfully they match with the institution is immature. And maybe that's what they're looking for: immature candidates who will teach only at the undergraduate level, according to the job description, and will receive no academic rank or tenure. Immature candidates with ""significant publications,"" of course.
To continue: Asking a writer to write some narrative answers to how well they fit into an institution is crazy? Most professors are required to submit evaluations for job review that include a narrative portion and I don't think asking this of a job candidate it out of bounds. They have a culture they wish to preserve, why is that a bad thing? And while $45,000 doesn't match the salaries of investment bankers, it is certainly not poverty. Surely that is a metaphor, but it's lazy rhetoric and privileged reasoning.
If you're 24 and single, $45,000 is great. If you're 35 with 3 kids, $45,000 is poverty.
So then you shoudl use birth control or get a different job.
Attacking a stranger urging job applicants to fight for the best possible salary is wrongheaded--to say the best that can be said of it. The author indicating that 45K is low is right. It is low, as are several other starting salaries advertised this year (though most of them are at state u.s, not relatively well-off schools like WW). And the respondent who says Asheville is a desirable place to live and that location is an important point to consider is also right, obviously. No doubt this year's low starting salaries are related to the current political and economic climate. But to call the complaint about that number ""privileged reasoning"" (a phrase more telling about its writer than anything else) also suggests that one has not had much experience on the professor-side of the great departmental divide. It is unusual for an English Department to request a written narrative describing how an applicant would make a good addition to its faculty; the analogy to performance review narratives is flawed, because the latter involves a faculty member writing about work accomplished, not work imagined. What WW is asking for this year is more similar to the college admissions essays high school seniors write. Disappointing, strange, probably, in the end, totally benign.
Thank you for the support. It's nice to see an intelligent voice here. The bottom line is very simple. Fight for decent pay. A contract between an employer and a teacher is a two-way relationship. Applicants are asked to prove that they will be committed to the institution -- but the institution must also convince us that it will be committed to its employees. None of us is going to get rich teaching these classes, but good employers will make sure that you won't be struggling to pay your bills -- and that your dedication and hard work will be acknowledged and rewarded.
I'm the person who posted the original comment, and I have to say it's really interesting to see this dialogue. Just to be clear: I am an associate prof (nine years as a full timer) who makes about $90,000. I'm on the market this year to support a spouse. The reason I make what I make is that I negotiated very aggressively when I switched jobs (pre-tenure) a number of years ago. I'm the primary earner in my family (two kids), and let me tell you, even as lucky and privileged as I absolutely am, it's *still* not easy. Keep in mind that as an academic your earnings, over a lifetime, will only increase within a very narrow range. It's not like the corporate world where one can (in theory) move up the ladder from, say, bank teller to branch manager to regional executive, etc. You will, most likely, *never* make more than $120,000, if that—and that's fifteen or twenty years from now! Do the math—think about putting a down payment on a house in your area, paying for childcare, saving for retirement, saving for college, replacing your car, and so on. Think hard about how much it will cost to live in a community with good public schools (or the cost of paying for private schools). And then get in there and fight for the middle class life you deserve. Keep in mind that the dean you're talking to has an income in the six figures and that even the campus police (as we all know) probably make more than you will. And then ask yourself: is it really costing Warren Wilson College that much to pay me $55k or $60k as a starting salary? Don't just do it for yourself—do it for all of us. Because believe me, these deans talk to each other, and they know that driving down expectations saves them money in the long term.
I'm not sure I understand all the outrage over the salary. Yes, I get that candidates should fight for better wages and all that, but I'm talking about the surprise over a small liberal arts college (that focuses on undergrads) offering 45K for a non-tenure track starter job. Any entry-level, undergrad CW job at a SLAC or regional state university is going to pay in this range (low 40s to low 50s). This job isn't associated with the Warren Wilson Low-Res program--it's an undergrad job that also has the person teach comp and literature. It's also not the kind of job you would ideally stay in w/ good publications, as you would obviously want to move on to an MFA program. Nothing about this job screams ""long term.""
Nothing screams ""long term""? Warren Wilson is a highly respective liberal arts college with an innovative service-learning model. It's definitely a place where *some* people would want to stay. Many writers choose to teach at undergrad-only institutions even if they have the option of joining an MFA program instead—it depends on what kind of teaching you prefer. And this isn't a ""non tenure track starter job""—it's a full time position that offers an extended contract in a school that doesn't have a tenure system (like Hampshire or Bennington).
A few things I didn't mention in my previous post: 1) This is what, the second or third year the job has been advertised? Doesn't that alarm you? 2) The salary, while not shocking, is on the low end and they're telling you the salary upfront--that's somewhat of a red flag 3) You should read the Chronicle of Higher Ed forums, where a few posters discuss WWC on the ""Interview Experience"" board--some interesting posts there that suggest the university is not on the most stable financial grounds and the relationship between the faculty and the president is problematic. Look, I'm not suggesting that it's a terrible job, but from everything I've gathered, it doesn't seem like a destination job. What's wrong with that? How many people stay in one job their entire lives?
No one can cry poverty and make demands for the life they ""deserve"" better than the American middle class.
Nor can anyone can throw stones into the well from which they drink like a misguided product of that group.
It's funny to see job seekers reciting the rhetoric of factory owners, trying to convince themselves -- and others -- that you can certainly support a family of five on $45,000 a year.""And if you can't,"" they tell you, ""don't have babies."" An employer's wet dream: workers with no children, no maternity leaves, no interest in improving their living conditions, no sense of criticism, no desire to fight for decent pay -- only eternal gratitude. The job will most likely be offered to you by someone at Warren Wilson who makes $120,000 a year. Take it or leave it, but don't try to tell us that it's a good deal.

NOTES AND QUERIES:
Q: What is an ""extended contract system"" exactly? Should I take from this that it is not a tenure track professor position?
A: Assume it means they do not have a tenure system; instead they offer extended, renewable contracts (although how extended is not clear from ad). Some schools do operate with this kind of system, although it's often a sign of a school with not much expectation for research activity.
A. Hampshire College also has a three year review system instead of a tenure system. There are a number of liberal arts colleges that have some kind of system like this as an alternative to tenure (mostly colleges founded or re-developed in the 1970s; Bennington College is perhaps the most well known). It really doesn't have much to do with research expectations (as faculty at these places are expected to be extremely productive)—it's part of the non-traditional philosophy of the institution. It does, however, make faculty vulnerable to extreme changes in the institutional mission, as happened at Bennington in 1993 when a third of the full-time faculty was fired.
Q. What happened to this job 2 years ago? Was it a failed search? Canceled? Did they hire someone and now someone new has vacated?",http://chronicle.com/jobs/0000693960-01/,Creative Writing,1039

A: That's what confirmations are for, right? It seems to me perfectly appropriate to drop them a line and ask if they received your application. I'd do it this week, before many offices close for the holiday.
A. FWIW, I never received any acknowledgment either. Given how little they asked for initially, I'm surprised they haven't sent out requests for more by now.

No hire for the global search. They say it is because the 4 interviewees for the position were impressive researchers but not what they were looking for as teachers. Or it could be that they're experiencing budget issues. Either case, the global cultures position seems to be out for this year.",http://www.nyu.edu/projects/mediamosaic/1011LSJobs/Core.html,Comparative Literature,183

Did the rejection letters go to those who had sent in additional materials, or those who were not contacted?
Rejection (after additional materials request): 1/31 by mail (x2)
Interview request received by email: (12/21; ditto 12/22)
Congrats on interview! May I ask what type (i.e. MLA, local, skype, phone) & approx. when they're scheduling?
A: local interview - scheduled for sometime the week of Jan. 10 or 18, asked to give dates of availability. Thanks for being so forthcoming. Good luck! A2: interview format not yet set.
Just recieved word that they will not be interviewing at MLA. (1/4)
Anyone know if these requests go out as one large group of emails, or are they spaced over a couple of days?
Looking at last year's wiki, though rej. letters over several mos. only 1 interview ever mentioned! Wondering whether these days perhaps they do fewer than 25 interviews, esp. when not attending MLA, otherwise seems a few more would have been noted? Actually there are lots of interviews mentioned on the Humanities and Social Science Postdocs 2009-2010 wiki.
Heard from reputable source that they are behind with reviewing applications--I am assuming that this means that lack of contact does not necessarily mean rejection. (1/10/11)
Thanks for this encouraging update.
Was informed at interview that they will be interviewing over the next 3 weeks and that we will hear back in early February. (1/13/11)
Thanks for the info.
Unless we see a few more interview invites soon I think we'll have to face the fact they're not doing anywhere near 25 interviews at least for this hiring cycle.
Received letter in the post dated 1/28 (x3) saying: we interviewed a small number of candidates already, but we don't know our needs for next year so our application process is extending into the spring and we are keeping your application active. We hope you are still interested and that you will let us know if you are no longer available. when was this? A: not original poster, but i received this same letter yesterday via USPS. thanks; no word yet, but I'm on the west coast (possible delay with snail mail?) and I haven't checked my dept. mailbox in a few days.
Same here -- 'we are keeping your application active.' Do you think they sent this to everyone not being currently interviewed, just in case they need us? A: doesn't look like it - a couple people who had sent in second round materials seem to have gotten rejection letters, posted above
2/14: Any interviewees heard anything yet?
Not me. I'm assuming they made some offers and are holding onto us until they see who accepts. Or, they just haven't gotten around to sending out another round of rejections yet!
2/16: Haven't heard anything either (after in-person interview) despite being told they'd be in touch in early February. (x2)
Interviewed at end-January, and they still had another week of interviews. So it's possible their schedule slipped, although I admit my hopes are more or less gone.
2/18: I called the office just now and *no notifications* have been made to any interviewees yet. They're a little behind schedule with the decisions because it's not clear how many openings they'll have. Take heart!
2/23: Interviewed in January, received email stating that I am still being considered but that they don't know if/when/how many spots will open up yet so stay tuned for final decisions. (x2) Huh. Didn't get that email; not sure if that means I'm higher on the list, or lower (although we may all have a guess as to which).
2/28: Re: number of interviews: Source inside tells me 24 candidates have been interviewed so far this year. If the past several years are any indication, they will likely do another round of interviews in the spring.
3/1: Still have heard nothing, post-interview. Anybody else? Anyone hear something beyond the email 2/23 reports? A: No news since 2/23 (x2)
Wait, are you saying you were interviewed and haven't heard anything at all, or are you saying you haven't heard anything since the email on 2/23? A (3/2): Interviewed in January and haven't heard anything at all. Of course, if they mailed me a letter rejection (as below), I may just not have received it yet. F/U (3/3): Yup, got the reject letter.
3/16 Anyone actually get an offer yet? Or any new interview offers?
A: 3/16 - Also wondering about this. I interviewed in January and received the 2/23 email about still being considered. I haven't heard anything since the 2/23 email.
I haven't heard anything since 2/23 either.
3/23: I received the 2/23 email and contacted the office today to ask for an update. The status of the search is stil the same as it was per the 2/23 email.
3/23: received an email to that effect, perhaps as a result of your call! Said I am still being considered, but they still don't know their hiring situation
5/23: I was the one who contacted the office on 3/23 (and had received the 2/23 post-interview email about still being considered). I have not heard anything about offers or the hiring situation. Has anyone who interviewed heard anything more recent?
Rejection (after interview): rejection letter dated 2/24, rec'd 3/2 (x2).
Any offers yet, or news about the hiring situation?

NOTES AND QUERIES:
Does anyone know what this means ""Information about screening interviews will be posted on the Writing Program's website in mid-December."" Will they contact people or are we supposed to keep checking the website? I was wondering the same thing. I think that they'll have to contact anyone who made the interview round -- they can't expect us to check their site daily. 
Did anybody go through this process last year? Did they send out sample essays to be corrected? Were there interviews after that? A: Yes, on all counts.
Similarly, does anyone know how many (approx) made the first cut? They really set the bar high for quick turnaround by making that one so soon after the first deadline. I thought for sure yesterday would be The Day. I've heard a good estimate is twice the number listed on wiki -- so probably 40-45? Another response here: It says on the website that they will interview around 25 people and hire 5-10 (can't remember the exact number now), so it is logical that they would request additional materials from a total of 40-45 people. A (?): No evidence, but I'd put the number at double that or more, considering how quickly the requests came and given the likely number of applicants (hundreds). It seems reasonable to think that this round would take longer, as they read the files in greater depth.
I just looked at the wiki from last year. The first email request for an interview came 12/23 and rejection letters were strung out over the next 4 months as they went through multiple rounds. Non-local interviews were on Skype. Last year they got over 400 applications.
Does anyone know what the salary range is for this job? I think it is around $49,000
Follow-up: Thanks, that seems low for the area but maybe is a living wage.
First year preceptors will make $49,000.",http://interfolio.com/hcwppp.cfm | http://www.writingprogram.fas.harvard.edu/ | http://interfolio.com/hcwppp.cfm,Rhetoric/Composition,1952

NOTES:
Does anyone know how many interviews have already been scheduled? I'm part of the group in the holding pattern. (4/6) --> They mentioned that interviews were occurring over a 2 week period, but (alas) no indication of how many candidates, and they were still determining how many positions would be available. (4/10)
3/19: Contacted and told still being considered but that they're in a ""holding pattern"" until they figure out how many positions they'll have open. Will contact if they want to interview. (x3)
02/16 Received update requesting additional materials.
02/03 Received update: Candidates selected for second round of consideration will be contacted the week of Feb 13.
Have heard nothing as of 2/2, perhaps they'll wait & see how the spring hires work out & just keep them so they may not know yet how many they'll need, if any, of those who could start in July . . .
Has anyone been contacted yet? From looking at last year's thread, it seems that they moved rather quickly after the initial deadline but I haven't heard anything...(1/16)
Has anyone heard anything at all, perhaps they've contacted some of the candidates who are eligible for the spring semester first & are waiting to contact the others? (12/27)
It might be helpful to look at last year's thread for this position to get a sense of the timing and other contingencies involved here.
That's a useful tip, thanks.",http://academicpositions.harvard.edu/postings/3804,Rhetoric/Composition,1952

It has been delivering education to the U.S. military on major Asia and Europe installations for more than 60 years, in addition to current programs on smaller installations in Australia, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt Sinai, Guam, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and The United Arab Emirates. UMUC seeks experienced faculty to travel and teach America's soldiers, marines, airmen and sailors, and their family members, in undergraduate degree programs at military installations primarily in Europe and Asia in the Writing discipline.
New faculty selected for these one-year positions will teach a minimum of two class sections a session in on-base education centers in UMUC's unique 8-week, 5-session academic calendar. With few exceptions, new faculty will live off-base, commute by car to their classes, and change teaching locations 3-5 times per year. Full-privilege, base access cards will allow utilization of on-base gyms, commissaries, gas stations, convenient stores, shopping facilities (PX, BX or NEX), banks, libraries, travel/tour agencies, and post offices. Most common teaching assignments are on U.S. military bases in Germany, England, Italy, Japan and South Korea. ""Downrange"" assignments in Africa and the Middle East are much less common, but may occur.
QUALIFICATIONS:  UMUC is seeking professionals who can combine academic credentials and teaching experience with travel savvy, enthusiasm for educating our troops, and a tolerance for adventure. All positions require a minimum of a master's degree from a regionally accredited institution with doctorate preferred. Candidates are sought who can teach a broad range of courses in their respective disciplines. Preference will be given to candidates with teaching approvals and experience in more than one of the desired disciplines. Although these positions are for on-site teaching, previous online teaching experience is desirable for hybrid courses which combine traditional and online formats.
Applicants must be eligible for individual logistical support in host countries and a favorable background check under the terms of the agreements between the United States and the host countries. Faculty members are required to accept course and location assignments, although preferences are given consideration. Faculty members may sponsor their spouses, who may also receive a full-privilege ID card; however, some assignments downrange will be unaccompanied (i.e., spouses won't have university or government support to accompany the faculty member).
BENEFITS:  UMUC offers an excellent benefits package, including travel expense reimbursement, military base privileges, health insurance, and retirement plans. A very generous compensation package includes base pay, housing allowance, session relocation stipend, currency adjustment, and optional overload teaching pay. Approximately 25% additional base pay and benefits for downrange assignments. UMUC will cover costs of travel to/from the initial/final assigned destinations.
TO APPLY:  An ideal opportunity for professionals at any stage of their career, this is a full-time faculty position with twelve-month renewable contracts beginning in August 2014. Applications will be accepted through February 15, 2014. Interviews conducted through March 2014 at U.S. international airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Kansas City, Chicago, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Washington D.C., and Boston and overseas in Frankfurt, London, Seoul and Tokyo.

--> This was the most cumbersome online application I have ever filled out. As a heads up, the online application includes a request for a diversity statement which is sent to the search committee: ""Please provide information on how you value and can contribute to the diversity of our campus.""
-->This was a cumbersome application, and I put a lot of time and effort into it, only to have my application rejected by an ""Unclassified Staffing Specialist"" in Human Resources, stating that I did not meet the minimum qualifications for the job. I am wondering if this is because I have a Ph.D. in English, with a certificate in Women's and Gender Studies, rather than a Ph.D. in WGS. I have eight years experience as a faculty member in a women's and gender studies program, and so thought I might be a good fit for this job. I understand how flooded the market is with jobseekers, and that the chances of actually landing this job were slim, but to not even have my application read by the department is incredibly disheartening. Anyone else have this happen?
--->I had the same thing happen to me. I have a PhD in English and graduate certificate in Women's Studies with a lot of Women's Studies teaching experience. I e-mailed HR and was told I could resubmit my application if I thought I had the minimium requirements. I just resubmitted my application (all you have to do is: go back to the posting, hit apply, and re-fill out the questions and just hit ""yes"" to the question if you have a PhD in Women's Studies). I figure the search committee can make the decision of if they consider a PhD in English and a Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies a suitable substitution or not.
--> As the holder of a PhD in Women's Studies with a concentration in literature, I am going to assume that the two above posters would have no issue with me applying for and assuming that I would be given serious consideration for a job in an English department, even if the job clearly said they wanted an English PhD.
Totally agree with poster directly above. I totally appreciate WS jobs actually requiring a PhD in WS. Those of us with PhDs in WS are NOT considered for jobs in disciplines - like English, Sociology, Political Science, IR, Geography, etc, etc. WS is an INTERdisciplinary field, and WS programs must start prioritizing those of us with PhDs in WS or we just end up without jobs. Period. My 2c.
From one of the two above -- I have graduate degrees in both English and WGS and had a VAP in WGS. Really, I think what it all comes down to is fit and what the search committee really wants in terms of scholarly research and teaching interests/experience. We all have to apply for jobs interdisciplinarily when our work is such. And for those of us who do queer studies, it isn't often that job ads specifically ask for someone doing LGBTQ studies.
-For those who received an immediate rejection, what did the email state? I clicked ""yes"" for PhD in WST, although my degree is in interdisciplinary studies with an emphasis in queer and gender studies and did not get a rejection e-mail.
I know that the search committee is only considering applicants with PhDs in Women's Studies, so I'm sure that that's the reason that some people's applications were rejected.
I'm the op, and I'm not going to resubmit my application for the job, based on the info here. Thanks for all for being forthcoming and sharing info. Best of luck to all of you. And to the poster with a PhD in WS with a lit. concentration, YES! I would be thrilled if you applied for a job in an English department, and if I had any kind of power I would give your application serious consideration. That's a rockin' combination, in a field weighted more and more towards the social sciences. I wish you extra good luck!
Just to complicate matters... I have a certificate but not a PhD in WS and was not instantly rejected. Perhaps the issue is not so much the WS PhD but the fields they're interested in (i.e. not English).
Just to clarify: Did you say ""No"" to the question of ""Do you have a Ph.D. in Women's/Gender Studies?"" and still *not* get the rejection from Human Resources?
Aha. I see now. I must have clicked Yes.
I contacted the department on Friday and heard today (Monday) that the search committee is meeting in 3 weeks to come up with a short list (1/30).

Regardless of discipline, we are looking for applicants with dynamic, productive, critical and applied research programs grounded in the study of one or more creative industries including: music, fashion, journalism, advertising, digital & traditional media and others, who are interested in themes and trends that cross-cut the creative industries such as the social and political impacts of creative industries, globalization, entrepreneurship and investment, governance and regulation, work and labour, the impacts of technological change, etc. At the outset the successful applicant will develop and teach core and elective courses to be determined as the program unfolds. Faculty in Creative Industries have opportunities to teach and supervise in Ryerson’s various graduate programs, as appropriate.

I'm at a loss - have only heard back from 1 top program, and the rest have rejected me. It goes to show how random the job market is. Anyone else have similar experiences? I'm trying not to get discouraged.
1/6/15 - Do *not* get discouraged. The job market is very very random in some ways. Stay active. Be engaged. Present at conferences. Publish. Keep teaching courses well. I am having this experience this year. And it took me a long time to land a solid position, despite Ph.D. from a top program, great references from great people, publications, grants, stellar teaching evals and great experience. Blah blah blah. Just keep chugging along. And most of all, and often most challenging, do not take the random job market personally.
""Anyone else have similar experiences?"" From what cave did you receive your phd?   
Is it just me, or are departments taking their sweet time to contact people this year?  It seems like by this stage in years past there have been far more interview requests.
My experience, being on the job market for a good number of years, was that people were contacted after Thanksgiving. But that's one response of many. And with skype interviews now playing a bigger role, hard to gauge. If you're on the market, try your best to distract yourself! And good luck!!

NOTES:
Just today my application to this position showed up ""Incomplete"" on Interfolio with letters newly requested. Did I just miss this the first time or was this a ""request for additional materials?""
I just checked Interfolio and see a newly ""Incomplete"" status for this application as well, but haven't received an email asking for letters.  Has anyone received such an email?  
Yes, I received an email asking for letters. Maybe they are coming in staggered one at a time?
Received a request for letters 11/23. My area is AfAm + US media/Hollywood, so maybe the requests were staggered depending on the joint appointment (French, English, AfAm)? 
I received an email too, late in the day on Friday. I think it is the next stage of the selection process, they basically added this new requirement and activated the folder to accept the letters. Once you upload the letters it will show as complete again.
So does anyone have an application status that DIDN'T change to ""Incomplete"" yesterday?
I also got a letter; wrote a response and got a very nice note almost immediately.  Though I know that doesn't add clarity to whether this is a long list or if everyone got a letter request.
(11/16) My interfolio application lists me as incomplete and needing to file letters too, but I didn't get an email.  According to the Yale office, only those people whose candidacy is advancing have been contacted; it seems as if everyone's Interfolio application is now incomplete though.  The person in the office wasn't categorical, but I think if you didn't get an email you're done.  A bit messy, no?
(11/17) Same here, incomplete interfolio application but no email. I guess everyone received it? Out of curiosity to those who received emails, what field of specialization did you identify?
(11/17) ^^ History and Theory of Media
Did anyone get a timeline for the next stage?
So has anyone else received NEITHER a formal rejection email NOR a request for letters at this point?  Am assuming I've been wiki-jected, but the quirkiness of this process is keeping faint hopes alive...
I had assumed I was out of the running based on the information here (although I missed that rejection emails went out). Today, on 12/2, I just got a request for letters of recommendation and a research statement. Weird weird weird. (My field: History and Theory of Media) - x2
I noticed on interfolio that there was a request for a research statement, but I was only asked for letters.  Was anyone else asked for a research statement?  Maybe it is a junior/senior thing? REPLY: You're right, the email specified only letters; I uploaded the research statement anyway, since it was there on the interfolio page and I had one burning a hole in my pocket.",http://apply.interfolio.com/31058 | http://main.hercjobs.org/jobs/7490537/faculty-of-arts-and-sciences-humanities,Film Studies,334
